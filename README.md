# Face Recognition

I used python to code.

FaceDetection.py is to open your computer camera to detect your face.

FaceDateCollection.py is to collect your face images and save them in Facedata folder.

face_trainning.py is to train, and save training information in face_trainner folder.

FaceRecognition.py is to recognize, after training.

Attention, you maybe change the path in the code correspondingly.
